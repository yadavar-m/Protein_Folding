    "## First progress report\n",
    "<b>Proteins</b> are  macromolecules consisting of <b>amino acid</b> residues. A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a <b>peptide</b>. Proteins can be recognized by their sequence of amino acids. The biological process that causes a protein to fold into its three-dimensional structure is called <b>Protein Folding Problem</b>. This structure can determine the protein's activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The protein folding problem is finding the lowest energy conformations of a protein given its primary sequence of amino acids. As it is a large-scale problem, scientists suggested <b>Lattice Models</b> [1]. Lattice models represent protein chains as self-avoiding walks (SAW) on a 2D or 3D grid. They use the <b>coarse-grained</b> representation of a protein, so each amino acid can be placed in a grid intersection. There are several lattice models, but only two of them are used in quantum computing [2]. The first lattice model (also the first proposed lattice model) is the <b>Hydrophobic-polar model (HP)</b> [1]. This model only considers two classes of amino acids, hydrophobic (H) and polar (P). The second one is the <b>Miyazawa-Jernigan model</b> [3] which uses all twenty natural amino acids. The problem is finding the minimum energy conformation of a lattice protein. It's proven that it is NP-complete problem [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "As Richard Fineman said, \"Nature isn't classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly it's a wonderful problem, because it doesn't look so easy.\"[5], we can use quantum computers to solve this problem. For solving this problem, first, we should encode the problem in a <b>Hamiltonian</b>, that finding the lowest energy can be considered as the <b>ground state problem</b>. Perdomo et al. were the first researchers who encode the problem in a Hamiltonian and solve it by <b>adiabatic quantum computing (AQC)</b> [6]. Then, some researchers tried to solve this problem by <b>quantum annealing</b> and usually used D-Wave annealers[7-9]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fingerhuth and Babej proposed a <b>gate-based model (Digital Quantum Computing)</b> for solving this problem [10]. They used <b>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)</b>. Also, Robert et al. proposed another gate-based quantum algorithm [11]. They used <b>Conditional Value-at-Risk VQE</b> (CVaR VQE), which is a kind of <b>Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)</b> algorithm by CVaR expectation value. \n",
    "\n",
    "For solving the ground state problems by digital quantum computing (or gate-base models), there are two algorithms, <b>Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)</b> and <b>Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)</b>. As we are in the <b>noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)</b> era, there are a few qubits and they are noisy, so we can only use the VQE algorithm that is compatible with noisy quantum computers [12].\n",
    "\n",
    "VQE and QAOA both are algorithms from the family of <b>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA)</b>. They are hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. There is a quantum circuit made by parametrized gates that we call <b>ansatz</b>. In each iteration, we measure the result, then optimize the parameters in the classical computer for the next iteration. This process is performed until the output of the quantum circuit converges.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this project, we will focus on the VQE algorithm and use the Qiskit nature package [13] protein folding document, which is written based on Robert et al's paper[11]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to determine the minimum energy conformation of a special protein. There are some kinds of lattices (cubic, planar, etc), here we will use <b>tetrahedral lattice</b>. For encoding the problem in a quantum circuit, we will use two kinds of qubits:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li>$q_{cf}$: Configuration qubits that are used for configurations and the relative position of the amino acids</li>\n",
    "  <li>$q_{in}$: Interaction qubits that encode interactions between the amino acids</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "Therefore, the Hamiltonian of the system is:<br>\n",
    "$$ H = H_{gc}(q_{cf}) + H_{ch}(q_{cf}) + H_{in}(q_{cf},q_{in})$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>$H_{gc}$ is the geometrical constraint term</li>\n",
    "  <li>$H_{ch}$ is the chirality constraint</li>\n",
    "  <li>$H_{in}$ is the interaction energy terms of the system.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The protein consists of the main chain of amino acids, and each amino acid can be coded by a <b>one-letter code</b>, so we can show each protein's main chain by a string of characters. Also, the protein can include some side chains that can be connected to each amino acid in the main chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For contact energy (interaction) between amino acids, we use Miyazawa and Jernigan's paper[3], table 3. Since we want to find the lowest energy conformations of a protein, we can consider it as a ground-state problem (VQE solution) or an optimization problem (QAOA solution). Here, we will work on the VQE algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "VQE algorithm can solve this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H\\ket{\\psi(\\overrightarrow{\\theta})} = E\\ket{\\psi(\\overrightarrow{\\theta})}$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "where:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>$E$ is energy / a number</li>\n",
    "    <li>$E_{0}$ is the lowest energy / eigenvalue of H / a number</li>\n",
    "    <li>$ \\psi(\\overrightarrow{\\theta})$ is the eigenstate of H / a vector</li>\n",
    "    <li>H is the Hamiltonian / an operator / a matrix</li>\n",
    "    <li>$\\overrightarrow{\\theta}$ is a vector of independent parameters and $\\overrightarrow{\\theta}=$ {($\\theta_{1},...,\\theta_{n} $)}$^{T}$.</li>    \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest answer for this equation is the ground state ($E_{0}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "$ E_{0} \\leq \\bra{\\psi(\\overrightarrow{\\theta})}H\\ket{\\psi(\\overrightarrow{\\theta})} $ <br>\n",
