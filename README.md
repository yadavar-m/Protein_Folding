# Protein_Folding
This project has been prepared for the QWorld QCourse 570-1 at Faculty of Computing, Latvia University. <br>
In this project, we first reviewed the Qiskit Nature Protein Folding documents, and then we want to change the Miyazawa-Jernigan energy model (MJ) to the Hydrophobic-Polar model (HP).
